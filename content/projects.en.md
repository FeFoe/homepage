# Design and testing of rotating lances for intensity improvement in shot peening.
**Bachelor's thesis**  
*Grade: 1.7*  
*Publication restricted until 2023*


# Study on the state of development of “Artificial Intelligence” in research and industry.
**Project thesis**  
*Grade: 1.0*    
The aim of the thesis was to explain the basics about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and then to analyze the worldwide spread and importance of AI and its applications. Crucially, it also examines the limitations and challenges of AI deployment. The main focus will be on applications in mechanical and plant engineering.


# Numerical computations of flow conditions in a diaphragm valve using the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM.
**Project thesis**  
*Grade: 1.3*  
Commercial software in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is expensive. With the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM these calculations can be performed without additional license costs. The project investigated to what extent OpenFOAM can be an alternative to commercial CFD software. For this purpose, a numerical flow calculation was performed on a diaphragm valve for which experimental data and data from commercial CFD software were already available.
