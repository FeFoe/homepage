👋🏽 Hi, I'm Felix.

🎓 I'm a mechanical engineer and currently studying production engineering with a specialization in information technology at the TU Berlin.

🎓 Before that, I completed a dual intensive degree program (210 ECTS) in mechanical engineering at the HWR Berlin in six semesters.

💪🏽 As a dual student, I was able to apply the knowledge I had gained in a total of 85 weeks at MTU Maintenance-Berlin Brandenburg. I worked on exciting projects, mainly in work preparation, process engineering and design.

💻  As far as my future is concerned, I hope to work at the exciting interface between mechanical engineering and information technology, helping to position Germany well in the Smart Factory/Industry 4.0 sector. In particular, data evaluation in quality management excites me.

🏔 In my spare time I am active as a volunteer, debating in the BDU and I am active in our scholarship group and I also run a handful of self-hosted software solutions.

You can find more information about me in my [resume](/en/resume) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-förster/)
