      <description>üëãüèΩ Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Felix.
üéì I&amp;rsquo;m a mechanical engineer and currently studying production engineering with a specialization in information technology at the TU Berlin.
üéì Before that, I completed a dual intensive degree program (210 ECTS) in mechanical engineering at the HWR Berlin in six semesters.
üí™üèΩ As a dual student, I was able to apply the knowledge I had gained in a total of 85 weeks at MTU Maintenance-Berlin Brandenburg.</description>
